# Trend-Tracker 🔍📉

A repository for the development of a Trend-Tracker tool. This consists of a hosted application which utilises API calls to retrieve articles about "AI" and "Manufacturing and AI". This data is standardised and then analysed, and returned to the client in a chart.js format. This is rendered into some 'cards' which shows key figures; a pareto graph showing frequency of results over time and a radar ('spiderweb') diagram to review the distribution of topics. This will enable a busy data analysis team to understand key recent themes of AI usage, and as insights mature and the tool develops, allow for the team to stay on top of the most recent technologies and their subsequent impacts and issues.

         <br>These were both produced using figma templates, available at:

I focused the user persona on a team-lead role, who would likely lead a weekly team meeting where a trend tracker would be used/cascaded to encourage discussion.
The below image depicts the profile part of this template.

I focused the user empathy map on a team-member role, who would be receiving the information in a weekly team meeting. Again, the below image depicts the profile part of this template.

<br> _User profile of a 'team member' for the empathy map_ <br><br>
By focussing on two different types of personas, I was able to better understand the elements of the tool and how they needed to satisfy different learning styles and ways of ingesting information. Understanding the scope of usage of the tool (i.e., in a 10 minute slot in a team meeting), I was able to ensure information was condensed enough to be read quickly, but still produce a meaningful result. 
I directly used the outputs of this analysis (especially the post-its) to influence what my user requirements looked like. An example of this is the output of the 'thinks and feels' part of my empathy map, which prompted ideas for future scope and emphasised simplicity in the design.
